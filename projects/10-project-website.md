# Project 1: Build Your Website

## üéØ Project Overview

Create any website you want using Q CLI assistance. Provide a design template, describe your vision, or let Q CLI help you brainstorm ideas.

### What You Can Build
- üé® **Any Website Type** - Portfolio, business, blog, landing page, or anything you imagine
- üì± **Your Design** - From templates, sketches, or descriptions
- ‚ö° **Interactive Features** - Whatever functionality you need
- üéØ **Your Vision** - Q CLI adapts to your specific requirements

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Project Setup
```bash
mkdir my-website
cd my-website
q chat
```

### Step 2: Define Your Website

**Option A: Use a Design Template**
```
I have a design template at "./template.png". Use thinking mode to analyze it step-by-step and create a website that matches this design.
```

**Option B: Describe Your Vision**
```
I want to create a [portfolio/business/blog/landing page] website with [your specific requirements]. Use thinking mode to plan the architecture and build it.
```

**Option C: Get Ideas & Plan**
```
Help me brainstorm and plan a website about [your topic]. Use thinking mode to break down the requirements, suggest technologies, and create a development roadmap.
```

### Step 3: Build with Strategic Thinking
Work with Q CLI using high-level prompts:

**Architecture Planning:**
```
Use thinking mode to design the overall structure and components for my website. Consider scalability, maintainability, and best practices.
```

**Technology Decisions:**
```
Use thinking mode to recommend the best technologies, frameworks, and approaches for my specific website requirements.
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
```
Use thinking mode to create a step-by-step development plan. Break down the work into logical phases and explain your reasoning.
```

## üé® What Q CLI Can Help With

- **Strategic Planning** - Use thinking mode for architecture decisions
- **Code Generation** - Create any programming language/framework
- **Problem Solving** - Debug and optimize with step-by-step reasoning
- **Best Practices** - Learn industry standards through AI guidance
- **Technology Selection** - Choose the right tools for your project
- **Performance Optimization** - Analyze and improve code efficiency

## üõ†Ô∏è High-Level Programming Prompts

### Architecture & Planning
```
"Use thinking mode to design a scalable web application architecture for [your project]. Consider database design, API structure, and deployment strategy."
```

### Technology Stack
```
"Use thinking mode to recommend the best technology stack for my project requirements. Compare options and explain trade-offs."
```

### Code Quality & Patterns
```
"Use thinking mode to review my code architecture. Suggest design patterns, refactoring opportunities, and best practices."
```

### Performance & Optimization
```
"Use thinking mode to analyze performance bottlenecks in my application. Provide optimization strategies with reasoning."
```

### Problem-Solving
```
"I'm facing [specific challenge]. Use thinking mode to break down the problem, explore solutions, and recommend the best approach."
```

## üß† Advanced Development Approaches

### Full-Stack Development
```
"Use thinking mode to plan a full-stack application with [frontend framework] and [backend technology]. Design the complete system architecture."
```

### API Design
```
"Use thinking mode to design RESTful APIs for my application. Consider endpoints, data models, authentication, and documentation."
```

### Database Architecture
```
"Use thinking mode to design the database schema for my project. Consider relationships, indexing, and scalability."
```

### DevOps & Deployment
```
"Use thinking mode to create a deployment strategy. Consider CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure as code."
```

### Security Implementation
```
"Use thinking mode to implement security best practices. Analyze potential vulnerabilities and recommend protection strategies."
```

## üì± Testing & Validation

Ask Q CLI for comprehensive testing strategies:
```
"Use thinking mode to create a complete testing strategy for my application. Include unit tests, integration tests, and performance testing."
```

```
"Use thinking mode to review my code for potential bugs, security issues, and performance problems."
```
